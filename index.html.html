<p> <img src="iot2.jpeg" alt="students" height="200" width="300" >  A non-profit organization, Muskaan Dreams, in Lucknow has taken the initiative to improve computer literacy in government schools, aiming to bridge the digital gap and provide students with the skills they need to succeed in the digital world.
According to recent studies, computer literacy in government schools in Uttar Pradesh is currently around 60%, indicating a significant gap in computer literacy levels, particularly among students in these schools. To address this issue, the NGO has launched a program, Innovators of Tomorrow to provide computer education in government schools in Lucknow. The program is funded by LTI and being implemented in around 22  government and aided schools in Lucknow. The program aims to increase access to computer facilities and provide training to teachers in computer science. The organization has established computer labs in selected government schools and is providing training to teachers to ensure that they are fully equipped to teach computer science. The program is also providing hands-on training to students to help them gain practical experience in using computers.
